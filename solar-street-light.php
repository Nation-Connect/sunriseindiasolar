                        <h5> Solar street lights </h5><Br>
                        <ul class="pl-3">
                        <li>Solar street lights are raised light sources which are
                            powered by photovoltaic panels generally mounted on the
                            lighting structure. The photovoltaic panels charge a
                            rechargeable battery, which powers a LED lamp during
                            the night. Most solar panels turn on and turn off
                            automatically by sensing outdoor light using a light
                            source. Solar streetlights are designed to work throughout
                            the night. Many can stay lit for more than one night if
                            the sun is not available for a couple of days. The system
                            is an ideal application for illumination of streets, cross
                            roads, forest and village lighting that are not connected
                            with power grid. It is provided with battery storage
                            backup sufficient to operate the light for 10-11 hours
                            daily. Unlike old lamps that produce a yellow-orange
                            light, Solar street light using LED technology
                            generate a very powerful and targeted crisp white light of excellent quality, which
                            significantly improves color rendition and night visibility.

                            <li>Solar Street Light is a raised light that uses photovoltaic
                                technology to convert the sunlight into direct electric current
                                through solar cells powering LED lamps to work throughout the night.
                                Being independent of utility grid solar street lights minimized the
                                operational cost.</li>


                            <li>Sun is the biggest source of energy, so no requirement for electricity </li>
                            <li>Very easy to install and can easily be carried to remote areas. </li>
                            <li>It is simple to operate and requires less maintenance as compared to other lights</li>
