                    <h5> Solar Roof Top </h5><Br>
                    <li>Sunrise India solar rooftop / solar plant solutions are designed to convert solar power into
                        usable DC electricity that is then converted in to readily usable 3-phase AC power. The systems
                        can also automatically synchronize with the grid or diesel generator voltage, frequency and
                        phase. The systems can also tie with the local electricity grids to provide credits for
                        electricity generation and savings on the electricity bills.
                        Ideal for homes, offices or manufacturing units with unutilized space on roof or terraces which
                        can be utilized for setting up the solar plants and provide great long term savings.
                        The durable nature and efficient design of the system ensure easy installation and low
                        maintenance even in the most harsh environments.
                        Our rooftop plants have been installed all over the globe, including many Government and Private
                        Project installed. This experience makes Sunrise India ideal partner to implement rooftop solar
                        power solutions.
